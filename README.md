Step III: Needle in a haystack

Next, let’s check your skills for working with collections.

We’re going to send you a dictionary with two values and keys. The first value, needle, is a string. The second value, haystack, is an array of strings. You’re going to tell the API where the needle is in the array.

Grab that dictionary from here, again by POSTing your token:

http://challenge.code2040.org/api/haystack

Locate the needle in the haystack array. You’re going to send back the position, or “index,” of the needle string. The API expects indexes to start counting at 0.

POST your results to:

http://challenge.code2040.org/api/haystack/validate

Use the key token for your token.

Use the key needle for the integer representing where the needle was in the array.

As with the previous step, these endpoints expect you to send JSON dictionaries in the body of the request.

Hint: You’ll probably use a loop to solve this one.

Step IV: Prefix

Great job -- but we’re not done with collections.

In this challenge, the API is going to give you another dictionary. The first value, prefix, is a string. The second value, array, is an array of strings. Your job is to return an array containing only the strings that do not start with that prefix.

Note: The strings in your array should be in the same order as in the original array.

POST your token here:

http://challenge.code2040.org/api/prefix

Once you’ve built your array, POST a dictionary here:

http://challenge.code2040.org/api/prefix/validate

Use the key token for your token.

Use the key array for your array.

As with the previous step, these endpoints expect you to send JSON dictionaries in the body of the request.

Hint: You’ll need a little string-fu to complete this challenge. But rest assured: comparing the beginnings of strings is a common task. Your platform’s standard libraries might even have some code to help you do this.
